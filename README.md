#Batch_Chat
==========

A chat made in Batch of all things.
This chat was initially created by me a few years ago when I started
to get interested in programming.  I have recently, for no logical reason,
started to improve it.  It cannot communicate over the internet directly and
I will not be adding this via a binary.  It can only send messages locally
on your network.  BUT you can use Hamachi or a similar program to chat over
the internet.

###Features:
  - Local Area Network (LAN) chat
  - Support for Virtual LAN IP's
  - Group chat
  - Colors (via colous binary)
  - Ping chat notification
  - Quick start
  - Command and help inheritance (for future ranks)
  - Tag -reset to reset all data
  - File encryption

###Commands:
  - /afk - Says you've gone afk
  - /back - Says you're back
  - /cls - Clears your screen of previous text
  - /clsfile - Clears the chat file
  - /history - Loads chat history
  - /host - Changes the host computer to a
          LAN/Virtual LAN IP
  - /list - Lists players online
  - /me - Say stuff about yourself
  - /quit or q - Quits the chat properly
    (PLEASE USE THIS OR ELSE /list IS USELESS!)
  - /say - Prints server message





###Plans:
  - ~~Add custom network drive/custom setup~~
  - ~~Add file encryption with crypt binary~~
  - Add rooms
  - Add legitimate ranks
  - Add an update system (eh, might as well)
  - Add encryption command
  - Add more creative, fun, enjoyable commands
  - Add custom commands
